# Question 1

```{r}
# approx prior predictive dist
N_sim <- 10000
theta <- rnorm(N_sim, 98.6, 2) # prior
y <- rnorm(N_sim, theta, 1) # body temps
hist(y, xlab="Body Temperatures")
```

We simulate some very high body temperatures (more than 105 degrees Fahrenheit), which seem unreasonable.

## Question 2

```{r}
N_sim <- 10000
theta <- rnorm(N_sim, 98.6, 0.5) # prior
y <- rnorm(N_sim, theta, 1)
hist(y, xlab="Body Temperatures")
```

I decreased the prior SD to 0.5 from 2 to narrow the range of body temperatures. So, my prior distribution is a Normal distribution with a mean of 98.6 and SD of 0.5. I think that decreasing SD any further wouldn't cover a wide enough range of body temperatures.
